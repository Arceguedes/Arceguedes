## ‚ö° About me
<h4>This readme is being edited right now</h4>
I'm a brazilian dev who is currently a junior level in Javascript/typescript and studying JAVA POO.
Graduating in computer science, I try to spend most of my time looking for ways to materialize my projects as optimized as possible.

## üöÄ My projects

In their 5# event, we made an online cart that simulates the one that they currently use in their app.
